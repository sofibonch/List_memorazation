# List Memorization Experiment

This repository contains a Psychopy experiment focusing on the memorization of lists. The experiment involves two types of lists: neutral and threatening. Each list comprises 12 Hebrew words, displayed for 1 second with a pause of either 0.25 or 1 second between each word. The pause duration is randomized for each list.

After the presentation of 8 lists (4 with long pauses and 4 with short pauses), a test phase follows. During the test, participants encounter 3 words from each list and 3 words not from any list but closely related to the correlated list. The task for participants is to determine whether a given word is new or was part of the previously presented lists.

## Experimental Design

- Each block consists of 8 lists (4 with long pauses, 4 with short pauses).
- The experiment comprises a total of 4 blocks, resulting in 32 lists.

## Randomization

All lists are randomized in multiple dimensions:
- Within their respective block.
- In terms of their position inside the block.
- The order of the words presented in each list.
- The pause durations between words.
